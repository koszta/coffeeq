  CoffeeQ
  Uses two redis client instances so that it can handle pubsub and normal events simultaneously (redis connections have a pubsub mode that prevents one from doing both pubsub and normal events simultaneously)
  @queueClient, @pubsubClient
###

class CoffeeQ
  constructor: (options) ->    
    options = {} unless options
    @port = options.port || 6379
    @host = options.host || 'localhost'
    @queueClient = redis.createClient @port, @host
    @pubsubClient = redis.createClient @port, @host

  # include call must come after the constructor
  helper.include(this)
